In this picture, there’s a busy street scene filled with different things! Right in the middle, you see a shiny silver van that’s large and ready to drive. Nearby, a red truck is parked on the road, showing it’s a busy area. On the side of the street stands a tall person, probably waiting or just watching what’s going on. There are also a couple of tall green trees providing shade, making the place feel nice and cozy.

Notice the bright red and white tail light shining from a vehicle nearby. There are also traffic lights on poles, helping drivers know when to stop and go. A black SUV is parked on the street, and another black car is driving by. The crosswalk lines on the road are white, guiding people safely across. Lastly, you can spot some tall street lights shining down, keeping everything bright and safe during the night!
