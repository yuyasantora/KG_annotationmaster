In this picture, we see a busy road filled with different vehicles and some tall trees. Right in front of us, there’s a big black SUV driving down the street. Next to it, there’s a red van parked by the sidewalk. On the side of the road, another SUV is also parked, looking ready for its owner to get back in. 

Overhead, we can see a street light shining down, and a traffic light that is green, signaling it's a good time for cars to go. There are signs that give directions nearby, which help drivers know where to go. Along the road, there’s a white line painted down the middle, making sure everyone stays in their lane. 

In the background, a row of trees stands tall, adding some green to the scene. Overall, it looks like a normal day on a busy street!
